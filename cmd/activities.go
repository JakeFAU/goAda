	Long: `Activities are Adafruit IO's list of actions you've taken to create, update, or delete objects in your Adafruit IO account. We store the last 1000 actions taken for:

	Dashboards
	Blocks
	Feeds
	Groups

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// activitiesCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// activitiesCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
